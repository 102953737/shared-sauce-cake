(4, 'Doctor: Hary Pham', '\n### Specialist in internal medicine\n\nMain article:  [Internal medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine "Internal medicine")\n\nAround the world the term physician refers to a  [specialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_specialist "Medical specialist")  in  [internal medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine "Internal medicine")  or one of its many sub-specialties (especially as opposed to a specialist in  [surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery "Surgery")). This meaning of physician conveys a sense of expertise in treatment by drugs or medications, rather than by the procedures of  [surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon "Surgeon").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-Fowler-4)\n\nThis term is at least nine hundred years old in English: physicians and surgeons were once members of separate professions, and traditionally were rivals. The  _[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorter_Oxford_English_Dictionary "Shorter Oxford English Dictionary")_, third edition, gives a  [Middle English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English "Middle English")  quotation making this contrast, from as early as 1400: "O Lord, whi is it so greet difference betwixe a cirugian and a physician."[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-newSOED-5)\n\n[Henry VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England "Henry VIII of England")  granted a charter to the London  [Royal College of Physicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians "Royal College of Physicians")  in 1518. It was not until 1540 that he granted the  [Company of Barber-Surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barber_surgeon "Barber surgeon")  (ancestor of the  [Royal College of Surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons "Royal College of Surgeons")) its separate charter. In the same year, the English monarch established the  [Regius Professorship of Physic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regius_Professor_of_Physic_(Cambridge) "Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)")  at the  [University of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-6)  Newer universities would probably describe such an academic as a professor of  [internal medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine "Internal medicine"). Hence, in the 16th century,  _physic_  meant roughly what internal medicine does now.\n\nCurrently, a specialist  [physician in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_in_the_United_States "Physician in the United States")  may be described as an  _internist_.

In the same year, the English monarch established the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regius_Professor_of_Physic_(Cambridge)" title="Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)">Regius Professorship of Physic</a>  at the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-6">[6]</a>  Newer universities would probably describe such an academic as a professor of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine" title="Internal medicine">internal medicine</a>. Hence, in the 16th century,  <em>physic</em>  meant roughly what internal medicine does now.</p>\n<p>Currently, a specialist  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician_in_the_United_States" title="Physician in the United States">physician in the United States</a>  may be described as an  <em>internist</em>. Another term,  <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitalist" title="Hospitalist">hospitalist</a></em>, was introduced in 1996,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-7">[7]</a>  to describe US specialists in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine" title="Internal medicine">internal medicine</a>  who work largely or exclusively in hospitals. Such ''hospitalists'' now make up about 19% of all US  <em>general internists</em>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-8">[8]</a>  who are often called  <em>general physicians</em>  in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_nations" title="Commonwealth of nations">Commonwealth</a>  countries.</p>\n<p>This original use, as distinct from surgeon, is common in most of the world including the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>  and other Commonwealth countries (such as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>), as well as in places as diverse as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a>, and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. In such places, the more general English terms  <em>doctor</em>  or  <em>medical practitioner</em>  are prevalent, describing any practitioner of medicine (whom an American would likely call a physician, in the broad sense).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-9">[9]</a>  In Commonwealth countries, specialist  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics" title="Pediatrics">pediatricians</a>  and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics" title="Geriatrics">geriatricians</a>  are also described as specialist physicians who have sub-specialized by age of patient rather than by  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)" title="Organ (anatomy)">organ</a>  system.</p>\n<h3 id="physicianandsurgeon">Physician and surgeon</h3>\n<p>Around the world, the combined term "physician and surgeon" is used to describe either a general practitioner or any medical practitioner irrespective of specialty.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-Fowler-4">[4]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician#cite_note-newSOED-5">[5]</a>  This usage still shows the original meaning of physician and preserves the old difference between a physician, as a practitioner of  <em>physic</em>, and a surgeon. The term may be used by state medical boards in the United States, and by equivalent bodies in Canadian provinces, to describe any medical practitioner.</p>', 6, -1, -1, 1, NULL, NULL, '2020-11-13 21:01:09', '2020-11-13 21:01:09', NULL);
